
1)Define the types of Operating System?
ANS>>
An Operating System (OS) is a software that acts as an interface between computer hardware components and the user. 
Every computer system must have at least one operating system to run other programs. Applications like Browsers, MS Office, Notepad Games,
etc., need some environment to run and perform its tasks.
The OS helps you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer’s language.
tYPES OF OS-:
Batch OS.
Distributed OS.
Multitasking OS.
Network OS.
Real-OS.
Mobile OS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) What is DHCP?
ans>>
Stands for "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol." DHCP is a protocol that automatically assigns
a unique IP address to each device that connects to a network. 
When you connect to a network, your device is considered a client and the router is the server. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) What is DNS?
ANS>>
Domain Name Server (DNS) is a standard protocol that helps Internet users discover websites using human readable addresses. 
Like a phonebook which lets you look up the name of a person and discover their number, DNS lets you type the address of a website 
and automatically discover the Internet Protocol (IP) address for that website.
Without DNS, the Internet would collapse - it would be impossible for people and machines to access Internet servers via the 
friendly URLs they have come to know.
(DNS) is a naming database in which internet domain names are located and translated into Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Expalin Paging?
ANS>>
in Operating Systems, Paging is a storage mechanism used to retrieve processes from the secondary storage into the main memory 
in the form of pages.
The main idea behind the paging is to divide each process in the form of pages. 
The main memory will also be divided in the form of frames.
One page of the process is to be stored in one of the frames of the memory. 
The pages can be stored at the different locations of the memory but the priority is always to find the contiguous frames or holes.
Pages of the process are brought into the main memory only when they are required otherwise they reside in the secondary storage.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Que 5) Explain segmentation ?
Ans: In Operating Systems, Segmentation is a memory management technique in which the memory is divided into the variable size parts. Each part is known as a 
segment which can be allocated to a process.

The details about each segment are stored in a table called a segment table. Segment table is stored in one (or many) of the segments.

Segment table contains mainly two information about segment:

Base: It is the base address of the segment
Limit: It is the length of the segment.
    Advantages of Segmentation :
1)No internal fragmentation
2)Average Segment Size is larger than the actual page size.
3)Less overhead
4)It is easier to relocate segments than entire address space.
5)The segment table is of lesser size as compared to the page table in paging.
     Disadvantages :
1)It can have external fragmentation.
2)it is difficult to allocate contiguous memory to variable sized partition.
3)Costly memory management algorithms.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Que 6) Explain Memory management ?
Ans : Memory management is the functionality of an operating system which handles or manages primary memory and moves processes back and forth between main 
memory and disk during execution. Memory management keeps track of each and every memory location, regardless of either it is allocated to some process or it
is free.It checks how much memory is to be allocated to processes. It decides which process will get memory at what time. It tracks whenever some memory gets 
freed or unallocated and correspondingly it updates the status.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Que 7) Explain the function of OS ?
Ans : An operating system is a program that acts as a user-computer GUI (Graphical user interface). It controls the execution of all types of applications.

The operating system performs the following functions in a device.

1)Instruction
2)Input/output Management
3)Memory Management
4)File Management
5)Processor Management
6)Job Priority
7)Special Control Program
8)Scheduling of resources and jobs
9)Security
10)Monitoring activities

Instruction: The operating system establishes a mutual understanding between the various instructions given by the user.

Input/output Management: What output will come from the input given by the user, the operating system runs this program. This management involves coordinating
 various input and output devices. It assigns the functions of those devices where one or more applications are executed.


Memory Management: The operating system handles the responsibility of storing any data, system programs, and user programs in memory. This function of the 
operating system is called memory management.

File Management: The operating system is helpful in making changes in the stored files and in replacing them. It also plays an important role in transferring 
various files to a device.

Processor Management: The processor is the execution of a program that accomplishes the specified work in that program. It can be defined as an execution unit
 where a program runs.

Job Priority: The work of job priority is creation and promotion. It determines what action should be done first in a computer system.

Special Control Program: The operating systems make automatic changes to the task through specific control programs. These programs are called Special Control Program.

Scheduling of resources and jobs: The operating system prepares the list of tasks to be performed for the device of the computer system. The operating system
decides which device to use for which task. This action becomes complicated when multiple tasks are to be performed simultaneously in a computer system. 
The scheduling programs of the operating system determine the order in which tasks are completed. It performs these tasks based on the priority of performing 
the tasks given by the user. It makes the tasks available based on the priority of the device.

Security: Computer security is a very important aspect of any operating system. The reliability of an operating system is determined by how much better security 
it provides us. Modern operating systems use a firewall for security. A firewall is a security system that monitors every activity happening in the computer and 
blocks that activity in case of any threat.

Monitoring activities: The operating system takes care of the activities of the computer system during various processes. This aborts the program if there are errors.
 The operating system sends instant messages to the user for any unexpected error in the input/output device. It also provides security to the system when the 
operating system is used in systems operated by multiple users. So that illegal users cannot get data from the system.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Que 8) Explain a Kernel ? Its Architecture and working ?
Ans : Kernel is central component of an operating system that manages operations of computer and hardware. It basically manages operations of memory and CPU time. 
It is core component of an operating system. Kernel acts as a bridge between applications and data processing performed at hardware level using inter-process 
communication and system calls.

Kernel loads first into memory when an operating system is loaded and remains into memory until operating system is shut down again. It is responsible for various
 tasks such as disk management, task management, and memory management.
It decides which process should be allocated to processor to execute and which process should be kept in main memory to execute. It basically acts as an interface 
between user applications and hardware. The major aim of kernel is to manage communication between software i.e. user-level applications and hardware i.e.,
 CPU and disk memory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.Explain a shell script?
Ans: A shell script is a text file that contains a sequence of commands for a UNIX-based operating system. It is called a shell script because it combines a 
sequence of commands, that would otherwise have to be typed into the keyboard one at a time, into a single script. The shell is the operating system's 
command-line interface (CLI) and interpreter for the set of commands that are used to communicate with the system.

A shell script is usually created for command sequences in which a user has a need to use repeatedly in order to save time. Like other programs, the shell
 script can contain parameters, comments and subcommands that the shell must follow. Users initiate the sequence of commands in the shell script by simply
 entering the file name on a command line.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10.Explain a page fault?
Ans:In computing, a page fault (sometimes called PF or hard fault)[a] is an exception that the memory management unit (MMU) raises when a process accesses
 a memory page without proper preparations. Accessing the page requires a mapping to be added to the process's virtual address space. Besides, the actual
 page contents may need to be loaded from a backing store, such as a disk. The MMU detects the page fault, but the operating system's kernel handles the 
exception by making the required page accessible in the physical memory or denying an illegal memory access.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11.Explain a deadlock?
Ans:Deadlock is a situation where a set of processes are blocked because each process is holding a resource and waiting for another resource acquired by
 some other process. A similar situation occurs in operating systems when there are two or more processes that hold some resources and wait for resources
 held by other(s).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12.Define the necessary conditions for deadlock?
Ans:There are 4 conditions necessary for the occurrence of a deadlock. They can be understood with the help of the above illustrated example of staircase :

    Mutual Exclusion:
    When two people meet in the landings, they can’t just walk through because there is space only for one person. This condition to allow only one person
 (or process) to use the step between them (or the resource) is the first condition necessary for the occurrence of the deadlock.
    Hold and Wait:
    When the 2 people refuses to retreat and hold their grounds, it is called holding. This is the next necessary condition for the the deadlock.
    No Preemption:
    For resolving the deadlock one can simply cancel one of the processes for other to continue. But Operating System doesn’t do so. It allocates the
 resources to the processors for as much time needed until the task is completed. Hence, there is no temporary reallocation of the resources. It is third 
condition for deadlock.
    Circular Wait:
    When the two people refuses to retreat and wait for each other to retreat, so that they can complete their task, it is called circular wait. It is the
 last condition for the deadlock to occur.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13.Explain a semaphore?
Ans:Semaphore is simply a variable that is non-negative and shared between threads. A semaphore is a signaling mechanism, and a thread that is waiting 
on a semaphore can be signaled by another thread. It uses two atomic operations, 1)wait, and 2) signal for the process synchronization.
Here, are characteristic of a semaphore:
    It is a mechanism that can be used to provide synchronization of tasks.
    It is a low-level synchronization mechanism.
    Semaphore will always hold a non-negative integer value.
    Semaphore can be implemented using test operations and interrupts, which should be executed using file descriptors.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14.Explain a mutex?
Ans:A mutex is a binary variable whose purpose is to provide locking mechanism. It is used to provide mutual exclusion to a section of code, means only
 one process can work on a particular code section at a time. 
There is misconception that binary semaphore is same as mutex variable but both are different in the sense that binary semaphore apart from providing 
locking mechanism also provides two atomic operation signal and wait, means after releasing resource semaphore will provide signaling mechanism for the
 processes who are waiting for the resource.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15.Difference among kernel space and user space. 
Ans:	User level thread						Kernel level thread
User thread are implemented by users.				kernel threads are implemented by OS.
OS doesn’t recognized user level threads.			Kernel threads are recognized by OS.
Implementation of User threads is easy.				Implementation of Kernel thread is complicated.
Context switch time is less.					Context switch time is more.
Context switch requires no hardware support.			Hardware support is needed.
If one user level thread perform blocking operation 
then entire process will be blocked.				If one kernel thread perform blocking operation then another thread can continue execution.
User level threads are designed as dependent threads.		Kernel level threads are designed as independent threads.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16.Write in brief the ping command.
Ans:PING (Packet Internet Groper) command is used to check the network connectivity between host and server/host. This command takes as input the 
IP address or the URL and sends a data packet to the specified address with the message “PING” and get a response from the server/host this time is
 recorded which is called latency. Fast ping low latency means faster connection. Ping uses ICMP(Internet Control Message Protocol) to send an ICMP 
echo message to the specified host if that host is available then it sends ICMP reply message

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17] . Explain UNIX?
Unix is a portable, multitasking, multiuser, time-sharing operating system (OS) originally developed in 1969 by a group of employees at AT&T.
 Unix was first programmed in assembly language but was reprogrammed in C in 1973. ... Unix operating systems are widely used in PCs, servers
 and mobile devices.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18.] Explain grep?
The grep filter searches a file for a particular pattern of characters, and displays all lines that contain that pattern. The pattern that 
is searched in the file is referred to as the regular expression (grep stands for globally search for regular expression and print out). 
Syntax: 
grep [options] pattern [files]

Options Description
-c : This prints only a count of the lines that match a pattern
-h : Display the matched lines, but do not display the filenames.
-i : Ignores, case for matching
-l : Displays list of a filenames only.
-n : Display the matched lines and their line numbers.
-v : This prints out all the lines that do not matches the pattern
-e exp : Specifies expression with this option. Can use multiple times.
-f file : Takes patterns from file, one per line.
-E : Treats pattern as an extended regular expression (ERE)
-w : Match whole word
-o : Print only the matched parts of a matching line,
 with each such part on a separate output line.

-A n : Prints searched line and nlines after the result.
-B n : Prints searched line and n line before the result.
-C n : Prints searched line and n lines after before the result.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

19] Explain pipe?
Pipe is used to combine two or more commands, and in this, the output of one command acts as input to another command, and this
 command’s output may act as input to the next command and so on.
Syntax :
command_1 | command_2 | command_3 | .... | command_N 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20]. Difference among Thread & Process.
A process is an active program i.e. a program that is under execution. It is more than the program code as it includes the program 
counter, process stack, registers, program code etc. Compared to this, the program code is only the text section.

A thread is a lightweight process that can be managed independently by a scheduler. It improves the application performance using 
parallelism. A thread shares information like data segment, code segment, files etc. with its peer threads while it contains its
 own registers, stack, counter etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

21.	Explain a scheduling algorithm?
==>  There are various algorithms which are used by the Operating System to schedule the processes on the processor
 in an efficient way.
 There are the following algorithms which can be used to schedule the jobs.

1. First Come First Serve
2. Round Robin
3. Shortest Job First
4. Shortest remaining time first
5. Priority based scheduling
6. Highest Response Ratio Next

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22.	Explain pre-emptive and non-preemptive scheduling?
==> Preemptive Scheduling is a CPU scheduling technique that works by dividing time slots of CPU to a 
given process. The time slot given might be able to complete the whole process or might not be able to it. 
When the burst time of the process is greater than CPU cycle, it is placed back into the ready queue and 
will execute in the next chance. This scheduling is used when the process switch to ready state.

Algorithms that are backed by preemptive Scheduling are round-robin (RR), priority, SRTF (shortest 
remaining time first).

Non-preemptive Scheduling is a CPU scheduling technique the process takes the resource (CPU time) and
 holds it till the process gets terminated or is pushed to the waiting state. No process is interrupted
 until it is completed, and after that processor switches to another process.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

23.	Define the different scheduling algorithms
==> 1. First Come First Serve
It is the simplest algorithm to implement. The process with the minimal arrival time will get the CPU first. 
The lesser the arrival time, the sooner will the process gets the CPU. It is the non-preemptive type of scheduling.

2. Round Robin
In the Round Robin scheduling algorithm, the OS defines a time quantum (slice). All the processes will get 
executed in the cyclic way. Each of the process will get the CPU for a small amount of time (called time quantum) 
and then get back to the ready queue to wait for its next turn. It is a preemptive type of scheduling.


3. Shortest Job First
The job with the shortest burst time will get the CPU first. The lesser the burst time, the sooner will
 the process get the CPU. It is the non-preemptive type of scheduling.

4. Shortest remaining time first
It is the preemptive form of SJF. In this algorithm, the OS schedules the Job according to the remaining
 time of the execution.

5. Priority based scheduling
In this algorithm, the priority will be assigned to each of the processes. The higher the priority, 
the sooner will the process get the CPU. If the priority of the two processes is same then they will 
be scheduled according to their arrival time.

6. Highest Response Ratio Next
In this scheduling Algorithm, the process with highest response ratio will be scheduled next. This reduces
 the starvation in the system.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

24.	Explain booting process?
==> Booting:-
Booting is basically the process of starting the computer. When the CPU is first switched on it has 
nothing inside the Memory. In order to start the Computer, load the Operating System into the Main Memory
 and then Computer is ready to take commands from the User.

Booting process:-
	This is the initial process to start the system. When we press the CPU main switch, the bootstrap
program get initialize in the system which sends the instruction to start the computer.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Que 25) Explain bias?
 Ans : BIOS is Basic Input Output System is firmware is used to perform hardware initialization during booting process and to provide runtime services 
      to operating system and program.BIOS firmware comes pre-installed in oparating system and it is first software to run when power on.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Que 26) Explain the difference among static memory allocation and dynamic memeory allocation.
 Ans : Memory allocation is a process by which computer program and services are assigned with physical or virtual memory space.The memory allocation 
      is done either before or at the time of program execution.Their are two types of memory allocation
      A] Static Memory Allocation  :Static memory is allocated for declared variables by the complier.
                                    The memory ais allocated during compile time.
                                    It uses stack for managing the static memory allocation.
                                    There is no memory re-usability.
                                    Once memory is allocated its size can not be change.
      B]Dynamic Memory Allocation  :Memory allocation is done at the time of execution(run time).
                                    It uses heap for managing dynamic memory allocation.
                                    There is memory re-usability and memory can be freed when not required.
                                    When memory is allocated its size can be changed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Que 27) UNIX commands like touch,sed,grep
 Ans : A] touch :touch is standard command used in UNIX/Linux operating system.It is used to create file without any contents.The file created using touch
                 command is empty.It can be used to create multiple files at a same time.
          Syntax:-touch file1 file2 file3
          Options: touch -a file1 :-This is used to change access time of file.
                   touch -c file1 :-This is used to check whether file is created or not.
                   touch -m file1 :- Used to change modification time.
       B] sed  :It is cmmand for stream editor.It can perform lots of functions on file like searching,find and replace,insertion or deletion.
                Mostly use to replace text.e.g sed 's/unix/linux/' file1.txt--> It replaces word unix with linux in file1
       C] grep :It is uesd to search a string of character in file.The text search pattern is called as regular expression.
                Syntax :grep pheonix file1,grep phoenix file1 file2 file3,grep phoenix *

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Que 28) Explain a process and process table?Define difference states of process.
 Ans : Process is nothing but program in execution.As operating system is multiprogramming,so it needs to keep track of all process.Process has short lifetime 
       than program.Process is runing instance of code. Process control block stores all information about process.It contains process state, program counter,
       stack pointer.The  process table is an array of PCB's.
       when process is created it goes from many states.
       1) New  :When process is being created it is in new state.
       2) Ready : When process is waiting to be assigned to a processor.
       3) Running : Instructions are beign executed.
       4) Waiting  :When process is waiting for some events to occure.
       5) Terminated :The process has finished execution.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

29. Define the benefits of multithreaded programming?
Ans: 
1)Improved throughput.
2)Simultaneous and fully symmetric use of multiple processors for computation and I/O
3)Superior application responsiveness. 
4)Improved server responsiveness. 
5)Minimized system resource usage. 
6)Program structure simplification.
7)Better communication. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

30. Explain Thrashing?
AnS: Thrashing is a condition or a situation when the system is spending a major portion of its time in servicing the page faults, 
but the actual processing done is very negligible. 
The basic concept involved is that if a process is allocated too few frames,
then there will be too many and too frequent page faults.

Thrashing occurs when a computer's virtual memory resources are overused, leading to a constant state of paging and page faults, inhibiting most 
application-level processing. 
It causes the performance of the computer to degrade or collapse. 
The situation can continue indefinitely until the user closes some running applications or the active processes free up additional virtual memory resources.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

31. Explain Belady’s Anomaly?
Ans:
In the case of LRU and optimal page replacement algorithms, it is seen that the number of page faults will be reduced if we increase the number of frames.
However, Balady found that, In FIFO page replacement algorithm, the number of page faults will get increased with the increment in number of frames.
This is the strange behavior shown by FIFO algorithm in some of the cases. This is an Anomaly called as Belady'sAnomaly.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

32. Explain starvation and aging?
Ans:
A) Starvation: Is the problem that occurs when high priority processes keep executing and low priority processes get blocked for indefinite time. 
In heavily loaded computer system, a steady stream of higher-priority processes can prevent a low-priority process from ever getting the CPU.

B)Aging: To avoid starvation, we use the concept of Aging. In Aging, after some fixed amount of time quantum, we increase the priority of the low priority processes. 
By doing so, as time passes, the lower priority process becomes a higher priority process.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

33.Explain a trap and trapdoor?
Ans: Trapdoor is a secret undocumented entry point into a. program used to grant access without normal methods of. access authentication. 
A trap is a software interrupt, usually the result of an. error condition, and is also a non maskable inerrupt and has highest priority.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

34.Explain a daemon?
Ans: A daemon (also known as background processes) is a Linux or UNIX program that runs in the background. Almost all daemons have names
that end with the letter "d". For example, httpd the daemon that handles the Apache server, or, sshd which handles SSH remote access
connections. Linux often start daemons at boot time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

35.Which application software's executed on OS?
Ans: The second major category of software is application software. Application software is, essentially, software that allows the user 
to accomplish some goal or purpose. For example, if you have to write a paper, you might use the application-software program Microsoft Word. 
If you want to listen to music, you might use iTunes. To surf the web, you might use Internet Explorer or Firefox. Even a computer game
 could be considered application software.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

36.Define daemon objects and thread objects?
Ans:Daemon threads is a low priority thread that provide supports to user threads. These threads can be user defined and system defined 
as well. ... These threads run in the background to perform tasks such as garbage collection. Daemon thread does allow JVM from existing 
until all the threads finish their execution.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

37. Give commands for finding process ID.
Answer :-
1) Open the terminal application.
2) Type the pidof command as follows to find PID for firefox process:
:- pidof firefox
Or use the ps command along with grep command as follows:
:- ps aux | grep -i firefox
3) To look up or signal processes based on name use:
:- pgrep firefox

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

38. How to edit, rename and move file in Linux?
Answer :-
1) A file can be renamed during a move process using the mv command. You simply give the target path a different name. When mv moves
 the file, it will be given a new name.
2) To edit a file, create a file first using the cat command:

cat > Demo.txt  
The above command allows to enter the content of the file on the terminal, enter the content of the file, then press CTRL+D keys to save the file
To edit this file, execute the below command to open with Vi editor:

vi Demo.txt  
The above command will open the file with the Vi editor in the normal mode.
This file is open in normal mode, to switch it to insert mode press 'ESC' key followed by 'i' key. Place the cursor on your desired position 
and enter some text. To save the file and exit from the editor, press the 'ESC' key, followed by :wq! Keys.
Now, we have successfully edited a file using the Vi editor. The editor will be closed after this and back to the command line.
3) To use mv to rename a file type mv , a space, the name of the file, a space, and the new name you wish the file to have. Then press Enter. 
You can use ls to check the file has been renamed

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

39.  Give 5 commands in Linux with explanation
 1. ls –
List directory contents. If you know windows you would know that the command dir is used to list the contents in a directory. In Linux, the ls
 command is used to list out files and directories.
2. cd /–
Change the current directory. The forward slash is to be used in Linux.
3. pwd – Print Working Directory
One way to identify the directory you are working in is the pwd command

It displays the current working directory path and is useful when directory changes are often
4. mv – Move a file
To move a file or rename a file you would use the mv command.
5. rm –
This command is used to remove files in a directory or the directory itself. A directory cannot be removed if it is not empty.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

40.  Which are deadlock handling situations?
In the multiprogramming operating system, there are a number of processing which fights for a finite number of resources and sometimes waiting 
process never gets a chance to change its state because the resources for which it is waiting are held by another waiting process. A set of a
 process is called deadlock when they are waiting for the happening of an event which is called by some another event in the same set.

Methods for handling deadlock
1. Deadlock ignorance
It is the most popular method and it acts as if no deadlock and the user will restart. As handling deadlock is expensive to be called of a lot of 
codes need to be altered which will decrease the performance so for less critical jobs deadlock are ignored. Ostrich algorithm is used in deadlock
 Ignorance. Used in windows, Linux etc.

2. Deadlock prevention
It means that we design such a system where there is no chance of having a deadlock.

**Mutual exclusion:
It can’t be resolved as it is the hardware property. For example, the printer cannot be simultaneously shared by several processes. This is very 
difficult because some resources are not sharable.

**Hold and wait:
Hold and wait can be resolved using the conservative approach where a process can start it and only if it has acquired all the resources.

**No pre-emption:
In no pre-emption, we allow forceful pre-emption where a resource can be forcefully pre-empted. The pre-empted resource is added to the list of 
resources where the process is waiting. The new process can be restarted only when it regains its old resources. Priority must be given to a process 
which is in waiting for state.

3. Deadlock avoidance
Here whenever a process enters into the system it must declare maximum demand. To the deadlock problem before the deadlock occurs. This approach
 employs an algorithm to access the possibility that deadlock would occur and not act accordingly. If the necessary condition of deadlock is in 
place it is still possible to avoid feedback by allocating resources carefully.


Methods for deadlock avoidance

**Resource allocation graph

This graph is also kind of graphical bankers' algorithm where a process is denoted by a circle Pi and resources is denoted by a rectangle RJ (.dots) 
inside the resources represents copies.

Presence of a cycle in the resources allocation graph is necessary but not sufficient condition for detection of deadlock. If the type of every resource
 has exactly one copy than the presence of cycle is necessary as well as sufficient condition for detection of deadlock.

**Bankers’s algorithm

The resource allocation graph algorithms not applicable to the system with multiple instances of the type of each resource. So for this system Banker’s 
algorithm is used.

Here whenever a process enters into the system it must declare maximum demand possible.

At runtime, we maintain some data structure like current allocation, current need, current available etc. Whenever a process requests some resources we
 first check whether the system is in a safe state or not meaning if every process requires maximum resources then is there ant sequence in which request
 can be entertaining if yes then request is allocated otherwise rejected.


4. Detection and recovery
When the system is in deadlock then one method is to inform the operates and then operator deal with deadlock manually and the second method is system 
will automatically recover from deadlock. There are two ways to recover from deadlock:

**Process termination:
Deadlock can be eliminated by aborting a process. Abort all deadlock process. Abort is processed at a time until the deadlock cycle is eliminated. 
This can help to recover the system from file deadlock.

**Resources preemption:
To eliminate deadlock using resources preemption, we prompt the same resources pas processes and give these resources to another process until the 
deadlock cycle is broken.
Here a process is partially rollback until the last checkpoint or and hen detection algorithm is executed.
